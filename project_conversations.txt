### Walkthrough / Outcome
I have successfully built and deployed the initial version of the Barcelona Streets Quiz app.

#### Changes Made
- **Project Structure**: Created a Vite + React + Tailwind CSS project.
- **Map Implementation**: Integrated `react-leaflet` with a dark CartoDB basemap for a premium feel.
- **Highlight Effect**: Added a custom "neon pulse" animation using CSS keyframes and Leaflet Polylines.
- **Quiz Logic**: Implemented the game engine in `App.jsx` with a robust `checkAnswer` function that handles fuzzy matching (ignoring prefixes like "Carrer de", accents, and case).
- **UI/UX**: Created a glassmorphism interface with `framer-motion` animations for feedback (Success/Failure) and smooth transitions.

## CONVERSATION 2: Enhancing Game Mechanics
ID: 4db38467-87b1-4aae-84e6-c91b926b8474
Goal: Enhancing Quiz Game Mechanics (Attempts, Timer, Visuals)

### Tasks
- [x] Game Mechanics <!-- id: 31 -->
    - [x] **Attempts & Speed Logic**: Implement 3 attempts, timer updates in App.jsx. <!-- id: 33 -->
    - [x] **Street Prefixes**: QuizInterface splits name/prefix. Prefix shown as label. <!-- id: 32 -->
    - [x] **Timer resets**: Timer resets on new question. <!-- id: 39 -->
    - [x] **Submit/Next Button**: Explicit button added to assist navigation. <!-- id: 40 -->
- [x] Visual Updates <!-- id: 35 -->
    - [x] **Map Styles**: Target Street = Navy Blue. Hint Styles = Neon Blue. <!-- id: 36 -->
    - [x] **Attempts Tracker**: "TRIES" label and improved dots visual. <!-- id: 41 -->
- [x] Social Features <!-- id: 37 -->
    - [x] **Share Button**: Results screen shows Avg Speed and Share button. <!-- id: 38 -->

### Walkthrough / Outcome
We've overhauled the gameplay to be more competitive and polished.

#### 1. Smarter Input
- **Prefix Isolation**: You no longer need to type "Carrer de", "Avinguda", etc. The game automatically displays the prefix (e.g., "Carrer de...") and you just type the name (e.g., "Balmes").

#### 2. 3-Attempt Challenge & Navigation
- **Submit / Next Button**: A large, easy-to-use button helps you submit answers and move to the next question.
- **Attempts**: You have **3 attempts** per street, clearly shown with a "TRIES" indicator.
    - If you guess wrong, the input shakes and you lose an attempt.
    - After 3 strikes, the round is marked as failed and you can click "Next Street".

#### 3. Speed Tracking
- The game now covertly tracks how fast you answer each question.

#### 4. Visual Polish
- **Target Street**: Now a **Navy Blue** line.
- **Hints**: Now a bright neon blue to match the "target" style, as requested.

#### 5. Share Your Score
- At the end of the game, a new **Summary Screen** shows your Score and **Average Speed**.
- Click **Share** to copy your results or invoke the system share sheet.
