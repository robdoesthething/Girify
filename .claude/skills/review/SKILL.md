# Code Review Skill

1. Scan the codebase for issues in these categories: rendering performance, data-fetching efficiency, bundle size, type safety, dead code
2. Group findings by category with severity (high/medium/low)
3. Present a numbered summary table before making any changes
4. Ask which findings to fix, or fix all if instructed
5. After fixes, run `tsc --noEmit` and report results
